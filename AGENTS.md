# Agent instructions

## React Compiler

The native app has React Compiler enabled, so components and hooks are memoized automatically. Don't use `useCallback`, `useMemo`, or `React.memo` — write plain functions and inline values instead.

## agent-device

Use agent-device only for app/device automation tasks.
For a normal app-driving task, start immediately. Do not probe first with `--help`, `--version`, `devices`, `appstate`, `snapshot`, or `screenshot`; open the requested app in the foreground and continue from its initial interactive snapshot.
For exploratory QA, read `agent-device help dogfood`.
For logs, network, audio, traces, or runtime failures, read `agent-device help debugging`.
For React Native component trees, props/state/hooks, slow renders, or rerenders, read `agent-device help react-devtools`.
For React Native JavaScript heap growth, heap snapshots, or retained-object leaks, read `agent-device help cdp`.
For React Native apps, overlays, Metro/Fast Refresh blockers, and routing to React DevTools or debugging evidence, read `agent-device help react-native`.

If `agent-device` is not on PATH but the user installed it globally in another shell, resolve the absolute binary path instead of using `npx -y agent-device@latest`.
Prefer `open -> snapshot -i -> act -> re-snapshot -> verify -> close` where supported; otherwise follow target-specific help.
Keep mutating commands against one session serial.
